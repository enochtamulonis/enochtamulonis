Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ⚡ Fun fact: I Am A Core Contributor to Rails

After years of mentoring other developers and leading Senior development teams, I have decided to try to reach many more developers by creating education videos on my Youtube channel 
like how to build any app you want. And many more informational content on Computer Science, and my experience as a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead
